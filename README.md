## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In the future for projects like this, I'd probably make use of frameworks like React to better take advantage of the component based nature of them, rather than pure HTML and CSS
